# Ditital Communication System Modeling
 A small digital system modeling.

 This project consists the following parts:
 
1- Image loading and converting to bitstream 

2- pulse shaping (Hlaf sine and Square root raised cosine) 

3- channel modeling 

4- matched filter simulation 

5- Equalizer (Zero forcing and MMSE) 

6- image recovery
